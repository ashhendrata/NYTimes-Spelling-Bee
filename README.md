## A summary of what I accomplished:
- Implemented a responsive keyboard listener integrated with the GUI, improving user interactions and accessibility
- Efficiently managed debug toggles, allowing for precise modifications to the game's logic and swift resolution of
input validation challenges, ensuring a robust and error-free gaming experience
- Engineered a dynamic ranking system that evaluates performance and showcases achievements through ranks

## The process


## Future plans
In the future, I hope to allow users to add in their own "valid" words in order to customize and personlize the game.
