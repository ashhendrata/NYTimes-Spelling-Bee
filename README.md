# New York Times's Spelling Bee Clone

This is a clone of the New York Times's Spelling Bee game and it was done in Java.

Through this project, I accomplished the following:
● Implemented a responsive keyboard listener integrated with the GUI, improving user interactions and accessibility
● Efficiently managed debug toggles, allowing for precise modifications to the game's logic and swift resolution of
input validation challenges, ensuring a robust and error-free gaming experience
● Engineered a dynamic ranking system that evaluates performance and showcases achievements through ranks

In the future, I hope to allow users to add in their own "valid" words in order to customize and personlize the game.
